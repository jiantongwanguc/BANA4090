Welcome to **Forecasting and Risk Analysis (BANA 4090)**! This course is for junior/senior undergraduate students. The main objective of this course is to provide you with the proper foundation to analyze and forecast time series data in the professional setting. This means that in addition to forecasting into the future and evaluating such forecasts we will discuss other topics to prepare you for your journey as an analyst.  A survey of analytical techniques used in forecasting. Techniques include exponential smoothing, Holt-Winters Model, ARMA, ARIMA models and model performance assessments.  Implementation issues and challenges are discussed.

## Description of Major Assignments
 
 - **Exams**  â€“ There will be one exam given during class after we finish module 2 to assess grasp of key concepts of time series analysis and forecasting.
 
 - **Assignments**  â€“ 3 take-home assignments will be given throughout the semester. Students will have 2 weeks to complete the assignments. 
 
 - **Weekly Practice Quizzes**  â€“ For each week, we'll have a practice quiz without time limit. The aim of setting practice quizzes is to help you solidify your understanding of the concepts we cover in class and build your confidence in applying what you learn.
 
 - **Project**  â€“ The project is a core component of this course. Students will pick a topic and dataset of their choosing to analyze and forecast with the methods taught in this course (and ideally some additional methods). These topics will be submitted during week 9 and the analyses will be presented during week 13. In lieu of a final exam, students will submit a reproducible markdown/notebook.

**Class video, homework and class projects are available in Canvas. Please check homework in Canvas and submit all your homework through Canvas. All announcements are in Canvas.**
